Then clone this repository – to either your own computer – or a Cloud9 workspace (best if working with PHP).

If using Cloud9, please create a new workspace (don't practice in the same workspace you are using for your group project).

I want to be able to provide you with course credit for CCC contest prep – if I am to do this, you **must track the work you complete to prepare for the contest using GitHub**.
