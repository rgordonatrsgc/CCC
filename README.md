# CCC

Fork, then clone, this repository to complete CCC contest prep.

I want to be able to provide you with course credit for CCC contest prep â€“ if I am to do this, you must track the work you complete to prepare for the contest using GitHub.

Please fork this repository to your own account.

Then, clone the repository to your local computer or a Cloud9 workspace (best option if working with PHP).
